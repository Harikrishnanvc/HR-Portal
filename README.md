Django HR Portal Application

This is basically an HR Portal application. Here, HR can login using their credentials and, after logging in, they can add employees, and they have access to edit the employee details as well. If they register an employee, the employee will get an email that includes their email ID as well as an autogenerated password. Using these credentials, the employee can log in. The employee can also change their password through a forgotten password session. After logging in to their employee portal, the employee can clock in and clock out. The employee can edit their profile details. The employee should be able to see the last 4 days' clock in and clock out details. The employee can chat with their colleagues through a chat window. Also, the employee can see the current date, time, and number of employees in their organization.
